# Text to Specs plugin for Sketch
Convert a text layer into a styled annotation overlay, grouped with a styled rectangle background.

Here's a [quick video demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=) showing how it's used.

Creating an Annotation
Simply select a text layer and press Cmd+Ctrl+T.

Re-fitting the Background
If you alter the text, you can re-fit the background rectangle by re-invoking the plugin.

PRO TIP: Since the group layer name begins with "specs", you can use the [Toggle Specs
  plugin](https://github.com/hrescak/sketchplugins) to quickly toggle all annotations off and on.
