# Text to Specs plugin for Sketch
Convert a text layer into a styled annotation overlay, grouped with a styled rectangle background.

Here's a [quick video demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=) showing how it's used.

Creating an Annotation
Simply select a text layer and press Cmd+Shift+A.

Re-fitting the Background
If you alter the text, you can re-fit the background rectangle
by re-invoking the plugin.

Go into System Preferences for Keyboard Shortcuts and reassign the Ctrl+V combo to activate Better Paste.  Life is good!
